## Building the Buyer App

1.  If you have not before, install the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki) globally on your machine with `npm install -g @angular/cli`

2.  Navigate to the `marketplace` Directory with `cd src/UI/Buyer/marketplace`

3.  Install dependencies with `npm i`

4.  Navigate to the `default-components` Directory with `cd src/UI/Buyer/default-components`

5.  Install dependencies with `npm i`.

6.  Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Note! - If you change anything in `/marketplace` or somebody else's upstream changes touch that folder, you will need to run `npm i` in `/default-components`.
