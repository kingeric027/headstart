# Theme

Want to add a new theme?

1.  copy `my-first-theme` folder and rename it to your desire
2.  Update names in [main.scss](../main.scss)

## Theming strategy:

Override, Override, Override.

You should only be doing one of two things when theming:

- Overriding existing variables
- Overriding existing styles

The base app strives to utilize bootstrap variables when possible.
